# hex2base64

For this first challenge, you should first divide the task.

1. Make a function to go from Hex to ASCII bytes. For example, the string `6d757368726f6f6d`
would give the string `mushroom`; `6d` being the ascii code for `m` and so on.
2. Make a function to go from ASCII bytes to base64 encoding.

## Hint

Go read about C's bitwise operators `&`, `>>` and `<<`. It will help you when you want 
to extract parts of a group of bits.
